##Simple theme for bash-it
* Get bash-it:

```
git clone git://github.com/revans/bash-it.git
```
* Go to bash-it themes folder.
* Get my theme:

```
git clone git://github.com/after.design/bash_it_theme after.design
```
* Set theme for bash-it in .bashrc or .bash_profile:

```
export BASH_IT_THEME='after.design'
```

Inspired by some 'oh-my-zsh' theme IIRC.
